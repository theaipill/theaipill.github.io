Hi, I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning specialist in Dallas, Texas (previously a Bay area native).
I have been in the AI industry for over 12 years now, have enjoyed being a spectator as well as an enabler, working on emerging trends (computer vision, deep learning era, self-driving vehicles, IoT, Generative AI and LLM's). 
It has been a delightful ride so far watching the field of computer vision blossom and spread it's web across industries. 
What we are witnessing today is just the beginning, and I am excited for what is yet to come! Probably AI will figure out combating climate change and my grandkids can have a normal long life.

I have a background in Electronics, Telecommunication and Computer Science Engineering.
I have adventurously worn multiple hats during my career- IC, Technical Lead, Researcher, Manager, early stage startup engineer < 5 engineers, interim Technical Product Manager.
I have experience working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds and skill-sets; small, agile startup teams, corporate cultures, mid-size and post-IPO companies. 
Though I have had my share of fun at diverse work cultures and team sizes, my dream tribe remains a small high-impact team spinning out quick MVP's with tangible, iterative, customer feedback loops.

I value curiosity, humility, knowledge-sharing and mature coding practices and believe that a good attitude surpasses intelligence any day for a functional & high-performing team.

My work life frequently focuses on solving problems in the following domains:
* Practical AI applications in connected vehicle technology (privacy, safety, distraction control)
* Intersection of computer vision and edge computing
* Machine learning based recommender systems
* NLP: Information Retrieval, Semantic context based search, Vector search
* IoT security applications and automation (smart home, shared spaces)
* machine unlearning theory for privacy preserving model generation
* facial analysis and tracking
* person identity abstraction, encapsulation and tracking in surveillance
* scene understanding and ontology abstraction
* semantic visual understanding and reasoning systems
* theoretical computer vision algorithms
* image retrieval for recommendation systems
* privacy-preserving AI and federated learning applications

Other areas I enjoy exploring in my spare time are applications of computer vision in medical imaging, climate change and traditional ML applications.
