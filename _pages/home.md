Hi! I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning specialist, with background in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering.
I am mainly interested in the intersection of computer vision and edge computing, machine learning based recommender systems, machine unlearning theory for privacy preserving model generation, 
facial analysis and tracking, person identity abstraction and encapsulation, scene understanding and abstraction, semantic visual understanding and reasoning systems and theoretical computer vision methods. 
Some areas I enjoy exploring in my spare time are applications of computer vision in medical imaging, climate change and traditional ML applications.

During my Masters from a previous era, I focused on the Intelligent Systems track, comprising of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, Patent Law, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. 
This spiraled into a decades long professional adventure in automotive, IoT
, enterprise surveillance, residential security, connected vehicle technology, logistics warehousing and driver-vehicle safety domains. I have enjoyed watching the field of computer vision blossom and spread it's web across industries. 
And I feel what we are witnessing is just the tip of the iceberg. 
My work has resulted in more than 10 multi-national patent invention disclosures and related publications in prominent conferences. 

As a seasoned player and spectator of AI growth in the computer vision and machine learning field for over a decade, I constantly question the end consumer of my work and strive to ensure that they are used ethically and responsibly.

I have had the good fortune to work on emerging high impact projects in a researcher and developer capacity at Toyota R&D in Mountain View
, unicorn startups like Verkada and Latch, Kargo-a seed startup company, Latch-a residential security startup (IPO'd) and lately at Toyota Connected North America in the Mobility Data Science group.

I enjoy working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds and skill-sets. 
I have experience working with small, agile startup teams, corporate cultures, mid-size and post-IPO companies. 
Though I have had my share of fun at each of these places, my dream tribe remains a small high-impact team spinning out quick MVP's with tangible, iterative, customer feedback loops.

I have worn multiple hats during my career- IC, Technical Lead, Researcher, early stage startup engineer/builder, interim technical product manager. 
I value curiosity, humility, knowledge-sharing and mature coding practices and believe that a good attitude surpasses intelligence any day for a functional & high-performing team.
