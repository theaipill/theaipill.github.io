Hi! I'm a Senior Computer Vision and Machine Learning specialist, with background in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering, worked across multiple domains including automotive IoT
, enterprise surveillance, residential security, connected vehicle technology, logistics warehousing and driver-vehicle safety.
During my Masters, I focused on the Intelligent Systems track, comprising of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, Patent Law, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

I am mainly interested in the intersection of computer vision and edge computing, machine learning based recommender systems, machine unlearning theory for privacy preserving model generation, 
facial analysis and tracking, person identity abstraction and encapsulation, semantic visual understanding and reasoning systems and theoretical computer vision methods. 

Some areas I enjoy exploring in my spare time are applications of computer vision in medical imaging, climate change and traditional ML applications.

Being a seasoned player in the computer vision and machine learning field for over a decade, I constantly question the end consumer of my work and strive to ensure that they are used ethically and responsibly. 

I have more than twelve years of experience working in a researcher and developer capacity in Toyota R&D in Mountain View
, unicorn startups like Verkada and Latch, Kargo-a seed startup company and lately at Toyota Connected North America in the Mobility Data Science group.

I enjoy working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds and skill-sets. 
I have experience working with small, agile startup teams, corporate cultures, mid-size and post-IPO companies. 
Though I have had my share of fun at each of these places, my dream tribe reains a small high-impact team spinning out quick MVP's with tangible, iterative, customer feedback loops.

I have worn multiple roles during my career: IC, Technical Lead, Researcher, early stage engineer/builder, interim technical product manager. I value curiosity, humility, knowledge-sharing and mature coding practices.
