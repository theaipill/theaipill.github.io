I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning specialist, with background in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering.
My work and interests frequently focus on the below fields:
* intersection of computer vision and edge computing
* machine learning based recommender systems
* AI applications for connected vehicle technology
* machine unlearning theory for privacy preserving model generation
* facial analysis and tracking
* person identity abstraction, encapsulation and tracking in surveillance
* scene understanding and ontology abstraction
* semantic visual understanding and reasoning systems
* theoretical computer vision algorithms

Other areas I enjoy exploring in my spare time are applications of computer vision in medical imaging, climate change and traditional ML applications.

### Background
During graduate education, I focused on the Intelligent Systems track, comprising of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. 
This spiraled into a decades long professional adventure in automotive, IoT
, enterprise surveillance, residential security, connected vehicle technology, logistics warehousing and driver-vehicle safety domains. Co-incidentally I took a patent law course at UMich out of interest, at that point I didnt know how it would benefit me in the future. I have enjoyed being a spectator and a participant working on emerging AI trends, watching the field of computer vision blossom and spread it's web across industries. 
What we are witnessing today (the hype with LLM's and Gen AI) is just the beginning and I am excited to what is yet to come. 

As an AI practitioner, I constantly question the end consumer of my work and strive to ensure that they are used ethically and responsibly.

I have had the good fortune to work on emerging high impact projects in a researcher and developer capacity at Toyota R&D in Mountain View
, unicorn startups like Verkada and Latch, Kargo-a seed startup company, Latch-a residential security startup (IPO'd) and lately at Toyota Connected North America in the Mobility Data Science group.

My work has resulted in more than 10 multi-national patent invention disclosures and related publications in prominent conferences. 

I enjoy working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds and skill-sets. 
I have experience working with small, agile startup teams, corporate cultures, mid-size and post-IPO companies. 
Though I have had my share of fun at each of these places, my dream tribe remains a small high-impact team spinning out quick MVP's with tangible, iterative, customer feedback loops.

I have worn multiple hats during my career- IC, Technical Lead, Researcher, early stage startup engineer/builder, interim technical product manager. 
I value curiosity, humility, knowledge-sharing and mature coding practices and believe that a good attitude surpasses intelligence any day for a functional & high-performing team.
