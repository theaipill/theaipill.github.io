I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning specialist, with a background in Electronics, Telecommunication and Computer Science Engineering.

---
I have been in the AI industry for over 12 years now, have enjoyed being a spectator as well as a participant working on emerging trends (computer vision, deep learning era, self-driving vehicles, IoT, Generative AI and LLM's). It has been a delightful ride so far watching the field of computer vision blossom and spread it's web across industries. 
What we are witnessing today (the hype with LLM's and Gen AI) is just the beginning, and I am excited for what is yet to come! Probably AI will figure out combating climate change and my grandkids can have a normal long life.

I have worn multiple hats during my career- IC, Technical Lead, Researcher, Manager, early stage startup engineer < 5 engineers, interim Technical Product Manager.
I have experience working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds and skill-sets; small, agile startup teams, corporate cultures, mid-size and post-IPO companies. 
Though I have had my share of fun at diverse work cultures and team sizes, my dream tribe remains a small high-impact team spinning out quick MVP's with tangible, iterative, customer feedback loops.

Other areas I enjoy exploring in my spare time are applications of computer vision in medical imaging, climate change and traditional ML applications.

I value curiosity, humility, knowledge-sharing and mature coding practices and believe that a good attitude surpasses intelligence any day for a functional & high-performing team.
I do pro-bono consultations, mentoring and reviewing. If you wish to reach me, you can do so via email or LinkedIn _(links on the left)_.

My work life frequently focuses on solving problems in the following domains:
* Practical AI applications in connected vehicle technology (privacy, safety, distraction control)
* Intersection of computer vision and edge computing
* Machine learning based recommender systems
* NLP: Information Retrieval, Semantic context based search, Vector search
* IoT security applications and automation (smart home, shared spaces)
* machine unlearning theory for privacy preserving model generation
* facial analysis and tracking
* person identity abstraction, encapsulation and tracking in surveillance
* scene understanding and ontology abstraction
* semantic visual understanding and reasoning systems
* theoretical computer vision algorithms
* image retrieval for recommendation systems
* privacy-preserving AI and federated learning applications
