I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning specialist, with background in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering.
My work frequently focuses in the below fields:
* intersection of computer vision and edge computing
* machine learning based recommender systems
* AI applications for connected vehicle technology
* machine unlearning theory for privacy preserving model generation
* facial analysis and tracking
* person identity abstraction, encapsulation and tracking in surveillance
* scene understanding and ontology abstraction
* semantic visual understanding and reasoning systems
* theoretical computer vision algorithms

I also enjoy investigating applications of computer vision in medical imaging, climate change and traditional ML applications.

I have been in the industry for over 12 years now, have enjoyed being a spectator as well as a participant working on emerging AI trends in the industry, watching the field of computer vision blossom and spread it's web across industries. 
What we are witnessing today (the hype with LLM's and Gen AI) is just the beginning and I am excited to what is yet to come.

I have worn multiple hats during my career- IC, Technical Lead, Researcher, early stage startup engineer/builder, interim technical product manager.
I have experience working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds and skill-sets; small, agile startup teams, corporate cultures, mid-size and post-IPO companies. 
Though I have had my share of fun at diverse work cultures and team sizes, my dream tribe remains a small high-impact team spinning out quick MVP's with tangible, iterative, customer feedback loops.

I value curiosity, humility, knowledge-sharing and mature coding practices and believe that a good attitude surpasses intelligence any day for a functional & high-performing team.
I do pro-bono consultations, mentoring and reviewing. If you wish to reach me, you can do so via email or LinkedIn _(links on the left)_.
