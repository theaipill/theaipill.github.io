Hi! I'm a Senior Computer Vision and Machine Learning specialist, with a master's degrees in Computer Science Engineering. In my professional experience, 
I have worked on some cool projects in object detection, scene understanding, object tracking, motion understanding.


I have more than twelve years of experience working in a researcher and developer capacity. 

I enjoy working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds and skillsets. I have experience working with small, agile startup teams, corporate cultures, mid-size and post-IPO companies. Though I have fun at each of these place, my favorite has been small high-impact teams spinning out quick MVP's with tangible customer feedback loops.

I have played dual roles, both an independent contributor as well as a Technical lead and I value curiosity, humility knowledge sharing and mature coding practices.

Please take a look at [some of my work](/work).

Here is my [resume]() ().

Please contact me with any questions (email on the left).
