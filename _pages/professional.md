While pursuing my Masters at UMich, I focused on the Intelligent Systems track[Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Image Processing, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics]. 
Post graduation I was selected for a brief co-op role at Disney Imagineering at the R&D headquarters in Glendale where I spent the next five months having fun with optics,robotics and re-creating magic with science. 
This spiraled into a decades long professional adventure in automotive, IoT
, enterprise surveillance, residential security, connected vehicle technology, logistics warehousing and driver-vehicle safety domains. 

As an AI practitioner, I constantly question the end consumer of my work and strive to ensure that they are used ethically and responsibly.

I have had the good fortune to work on emerging high impact projects in a researcher and developer capacity at Toyota R&D in Mountain View
, unicorn startups like Verkada and Latch, Kargo-a seed startup company, Latch-a residential security startup (IPO'd) and lately at Toyota Connected North America in the Mobility Data Science group.

My work has resulted in more than 10 multi-national patent invention disclosures and related publications in prominent conferences.
