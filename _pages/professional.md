During my undergrad, I worked on analyzing faulty point machines using pattern recognition techniques under the supervision of [Dr. Ravishankar Dudhe](https://www.manipaldubai.com/soeit/faculty/faculty-list/ravishankar-dudhe.html), which sparked my interest in Machine Learning. 
I got accepted for the Masters in Computer Science program at UMich, where I focused on the Intelligent Systems track [Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Image Processing, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics]. 
Post graduation I was selected for a brief co-op role at Disney Imagineering at the R&D headquarters in Glendale. I spent the next five months working under the guidance of distingiushed Senior Scientist [Dr. Lanny Smoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanny_Smoot), having fun with optics,robotics and re-creating magic with science.
These cumulative experiences established my foundations for a decades long professional AI adventure in automotive, IoT
, enterprise surveillance, residential security, connected vehicle technology, logistics warehousing and driver-vehicle safety domains. 

I have been fortunate to work on high impact projects in a researcher and developer capacity at Toyota R&D in Mountain View
, unicorn startups like Verkada and Latch, Kargo-a seed startup company, Latch-a residential security startup (IPO'd) and lately at Toyota Connected North America in the Mobility Data Science group.

My work has resulted in more than 10 multi-national patent invention disclosures and related publications in prominent conferences.

As an AI practitioner, I constantly question the end consumer of my work and strive to ensure that they are used ethically and responsibly.
