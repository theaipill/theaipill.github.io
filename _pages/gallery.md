I was invited by IEEE ITSC (Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference) to serve as Session for two regular tracks on Driver Assistance Systems. This was around the beginning of the self-driving era, and I was fortunate to be considered for this opportunity, where I helped facilitate the different paper presentations and Q&A from an international audience.

While at SAE World Congress 2016 in Detroit for my talk on my paper, I was part of an invite-only lunch with Toyota Motor Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, who was also the featured speaker at the conference. This was a special moment for me, as I was the only woman(and the only Indian) from a total of ~65 invitees.
