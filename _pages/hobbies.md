Besides my professional work, I have a keen interest in philosophy, social theory and the last few years with feminist philosophy. 
In school I was quite obsessed with trigonometry and, with complex systems during undergrad. 
Someday I want to pick these where I left off! 

I delved briefly in Complex Systems during my Masters and it has been one of the most fascinating course of my education. 
I have a Goldendoodle named Kishmish, my latest obsession and who is also my WFH deskmate. 

Like most Indians, I am multi-lingual and speak three languages fluently (Engligh, Tamil and Hindi). 
I took French for two years in college, beginner Japanese during my research dayas at Toyota and Marathi during school. 
So six in total though I cant speak basic French to save my life, excusez-moi! And the Japanese is quite useful on Ramen weekends!
